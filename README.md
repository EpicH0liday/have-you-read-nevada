# README

For all the James H's out there

This is currently an unstyled, messy piece of shit. It'll be cleaned in the next few days.

It's hosted on github-pages.
Just push this to the `gh-pages` branch to push it live.
It will be live at `yourUserName.github.io/have-you-read-nevada`

### Local Development
Finally, if youâ€™d like to preview your site before committing/deploying using jekyll serve, be sure to pass an empty string to the `--baseurl` option, so that you can view everything at localhost:4000 normally (without /project-name at the beginning): `jekyll serve --baseurl ''` otherwise you can view it at `localhost:4000/have-you-read-nevada`
